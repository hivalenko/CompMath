# comp-math
Laboratory works for computational maths cours in ITMO.

First two laboratory works are text programs. Third is web application, which, as far as I can remember was never finished.

For this project was used [a hierarchical text menu](https://github.com/hivalenko/hierarchical-menu.)
## Method implemented in each program

First - Gaussian elimination

Second - Simpson's rule with 3 possible integrals

Third - Newton polynomial
