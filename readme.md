Laboratory works for computational maths cours in ITMO.

First two laboratory works are text programs. Second is web application. 

## Method implemented in each program

First - Gaussian elimination
Second - Simpson's rule with 3 possible integrals
Third - Newton polynomial

As far as I can remember third lab was never finished.
